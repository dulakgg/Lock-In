# Lock In

This mod prevents you from exiting, entering practice mode, or restarting a level with the simple press of a button in the top left corner in the pause menu, making it almost impossible for you to accidentally exit a level (I will still find a way to accidentally exit at chapter 6 of throat of the world for the 4th time). It also blocks keybinds like Ctrl+R.
